## How It Works

1. The page estimates your “my  life seconds” using a fixed number.
2. It calculates **elapsed time** since year 1 AD and subtracts it from the total.
3. The remaining seconds are displayed and updated **every second**.
4. Includes a motivational message below the timer for whoever sees it.
